## Overview

ValueTrack is a Machine Learning based project that predicts the **Lifetime Value (LTV)** of a customer for a retail/fashion brand. By analyzing customer behavior, purchase history, demographics, and shopping patterns, the model estimates how much value a customer will bring to the business over time.

This helps businesses identify their most valuable customers, optimize marketing spend, and improve customer retention strategies.

## Key Business Questions Answered

1. **Who are our most valuable customers?** Can we identify the specific traits (e.g., location, age, gender) of customers who generate the highest lifetime value?
2. **How does engagement impact spending?** Does having a subscription, using promo codes, or selecting express shipping significantly increase a customer's total value?
3. **Which product categories drive loyalty?** Are there specific product categories (e.g., Outerwear vs. Accessories) that lead to longer retention and higher overall spend?
4. **What is the projected value of a new customer?** Can we accurately predict a new user's lifetime spend based on their initial profile and first few purchases?
