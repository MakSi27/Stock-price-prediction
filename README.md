## Overview

ValueTrack is a Machine Learning based project that predicts the **Lifetime Value (LTV)** of a customer for a retail/fashion brand. By analyzing customer behavior, purchase history, demographics, and shopping patterns, the model estimates how much value a customer will bring to the business over time.

This helps businesses identify their most valuable customers, optimize marketing spend, and improve customer retention strategies.

## Project Workflow

```
Raw Data → EDA → Feature Engineering → RFM Analysis → Model Building → LTV Prediction → Insights
```

1. **Data Cleaning** — Handle missing values, fix data types
2. **EDA** — Explore patterns, purchase behavior, seasonal trends
3. **Feature Engineering** — Build RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) features
4. **LTV Calculation** — Define and compute LTV target variable
5. **Model Building** — Train ML models (Linear Regression, XGBoost, Random Forest)
6. **Evaluation** — RMSE, MAE, R2 Score
7. **Insights** — Top customer segments, high value customer profiles
